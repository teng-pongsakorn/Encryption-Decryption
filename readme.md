# [Project: Encryption-Decryption](https://hyperskill.org/projects/46)

## About
* Privacy is an important matter is the realm of the Internet. When sending a message, you want to be sure that no-one but the addressee with the key can read it. The entirety of the modern Web is encrypted - take https for example! Don’t stay behind: hop on the encryption/decryption train and learn the essential basics while implementing this simple project.

## Learning outcomes
* Gradually get familiar with Java, paying special attention to working with files and the command line.

##  What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
- ####Stage 1/6: Encrypted!
  - Learn to input the data and encrypt it, replacing the letters.
- ####Stage 2/6: Knowledge is key
  - Learn to encrypt messages with a numeric key, using the Caesar cypher.
- ####Stage 3/6: Decrypted!
  - Encrypting a message is only half of the deal: now learn to decrypt it as well, using a standard Unicode table
- ####Stage 4/6: I command you
  - Practice working with the command line, using it for passing the mode, the key and the string.
- ####Stage 5/6: X-files
  - Work with files: learn to store your data in a file.
- ####Stage 6/6: Choices, choices
  -  Add the possibility to choose a specific encryption algorithm: Ceasar or Unicode.
